## Using the Authorization Header
For all protected routes, include the following HTTP header:

```
- The `<accessToken>` is obtained from the login or refresh endpoint.
- If the token is missing or invalid, the API will return 401 or 403 errors.

## Important Details & Tips
- Always use HTTPS in production to protect tokens.
- Access tokens are short-lived; use refresh tokens to obtain new ones.
- Store refresh tokens securely (preferably HTTP-only cookies or secure storage).
- Never share your tokens publicly.
- If a token is compromised, use the logout endpoint to invalidate the refresh token.
- For frontend apps, store the access token in memory or secure storage, not in localStorage if possible.
