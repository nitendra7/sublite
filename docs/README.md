## Getting Started

This documentation provides detailed information about the UI components available in the Sublite application. Each component is documented with:

- Import instructions
- Component structure
- Available props
- Usage examples

## Design Principles

The UI components follow these design principles:

1. **Consistency** - Components share a common design language and behavior patterns
2. **Accessibility** - Components are built with accessibility in mind, following WAI-ARIA practices
3. **Customization** - Components can be customized through props and CSS variables
4. **Responsiveness** - Components are designed to work across different screen sizes

## Prop Validation

All components use PropTypes for prop validation, ensuring type safety and providing clear documentation of expected props.

## Theming

Components use CSS variables for theming, allowing for easy customization of colors, spacing, and other design tokens. The main theme variables are defined in the global CSS file.
